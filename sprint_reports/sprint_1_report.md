#### Reflection Statements
| Team Member | Contribution Reflection Statement |
|-------------|-------------------|
|Dan| Sprint 1 was entirely focused on quantum computing, encryption, and the underlying mathematical principles. In order to truly express positive knowledge of the material, I felt I had to internalize it to the point where I could then teach it, at least in a rudimentary fashion. The first presentation was a comprehensive on the fundamentals of the quantum model of computation, and the probabilistic mechanisms that underly its action. The second presentation was a deep dive into encryption, the mathematical structures that motivate it (mostly group theory), and quantum encryption algorithms. |
|Emma| My main focus for this milestone was on an overview of cloud computing. I put in hours of research on what cloud computing and cloud native is. For the first presentation, I gave an overview of cloud computing and cloud native. For the second presentation, I researched and presented an overview of proxies. I also explained what Envoy is. Aside from my own presentation materials, I spent a lot of time studying the other group members materials, especially the quantum computing materials. |
|Connor| For this milestone I was primarily focused on learning the basics of cloud computing and learning selected specifics to a level where I could teach my fellow group members during our presentations. For the first presentation I was primarily focused on various cloud computing models, their use cases, and their associated benefits and drawbacks. For the second presentation I have been focusing on the underlying technologies that enable cloud computing to take place such as TCP, UDP, and TLS. In addition to preparing information to present to my groupmates and sponsor, I have been studying quantum computing basics and the requisite background mathematics to properly understand quantum computation. |
|Matt| This sprint, I worked on the Cloud Computing team and helped prepare two, 1 1/2 hour long presentations on cloud computing, so we could teach the other half of our team about cloud computing. In order to create the presentation, I had to spend dozens of hours learning about virtual machines, containerization technology, Docker, Kubernetes, reverse proxies, load balancing, and NGINX. I also created two code demos that we showed at the end of our presentations to help solidify the material we presented. One of the code demos was a Docker tutorial and the other one was an NGINX tutorial. I also helped write the Project Requirements Draft with Connor and I made our Sprint 1 Update video. |

### Testing

Since we have not done any coding yet, the only testing that we had was making sure that we understood the material that our sponsor wanted us to understand (quantum and cloud computing). We tested our knowledge by presenting the material to our sponsor. He asked us questions to ensure that we understood the material to the extent that he wanted.

#### Reflection Statements
| Team Member | Communication Reflection Statement |
|-------------|-------------------|
|Dan| I am pleased to say that I have learned a lot about communication in the time we've worked together. We have faced challenges from time differences to learning new materials to navigating different work schedules and styles. Through each issues, we've come together as a team and effectively implemented solutions and work-arounds. I know I have grown as a communicator, as a mediator for the team, and as a computer scientist. |
|Emma| Throughout this first sprint, I have learned a lot about working with others on a big project. My communication was mostly over discord, zoom, and in person meetings. I tried to check discord at least twice a day during the weekdays and more often when deadlines were near. I tried to answer teammates questions as quickly and clearly as possible. Whenever I had a question I would message on discord and my teammates were great about responding in a timely manner. Lastly, I tried to give as much input as I could during meetings. |
|Connor| Honestly throughout this semester I feel like our entire team has done an exemplary job communicating with each other, while we may not always agree on all topics we certainly have not refrained from expressing our thoughts on various issues. Our discord has been extremely active and it is very rare that a day goes by without someone posting about something and I have yet to see a post get ignored. Personally I was initially having some issues communicating when I needed more time on certain topics, however now that I have become more comfortable with my team this issue has diminished. |
|Matt| At the beginning of the semester, we had some communication issues because we hadn't worked with each other before. For example, there was some conflict scheduling our meeting times because half of our team wakes up early in the morning (around 5 am - 6 am), while the other half wakes up around 10 am. Fortunately, we were able to resolve these issues and for the past two weeks of the sprint, we haven't had any more scheduling issues or communication errors. In terms of my personal communication with the team, if I'm being honest, I feel like I messed up earlier on in the sprint, when I didn't communicate to my team one week that I needed more time to complete the assignment. Since then I've tried to be better with my communication and I've been letting my team know if I need more time to complete my work. |

### Retrospective

We forgot to record this sprint's retrospective but we will record the next one. Here are some key notes from our meeting:
- At first, we had some issues communicating. We were all on different schedules and had troubles adjusting to other team member's schedules
- Quickly, we addressed each others concerns about work habits and our team cohesion increased drastically
- We like working in small teams and presenting and editing other team's work

#### What went well
  - Our division of labor for the presentations went smoothly. We split into two groups where one group presented cloud computing and the other presented quantum computing while the other group listened. The other group then spent additional time studying the material from the other group. This allowed both groups to become well versed in both knowledge areas. 
  - We presented each presentation twice. First we did a practice presentation where we presented the presentation just to the other group so that they could ask questions throughout the presentation. Then, we presented a second time with the sponsor to solidify the other group's knowledge. 
  - We split into small groups for creating documents, such as the design document and requirements document. The people who did not write the document were in charge of editing the document before submission.
  
 #### What we'd like to improve
  - Stick stronger to our deadlines.
  - Begin the coding portion of our project.
  - Increase the amount of communication between our group.
  - Be aware of course expectations beyond what our advisor is asking us to do.
  
#### Changes we plan to implement in next sprint period
  - We hope to meet with our sponsor and gain a clearer understanding of what we will be implementing for our project so that we can begin the coding portion.
  - Have solid deadlines for the coding portion of our project.
